# Hi, I'm Tushar Kanti Mandal 👋👨‍💻

I am a structural engineer and researcher in computational mechanics, deeply passionate about numerical modelling and simulation. My work focuses on understanding and predicting environmentally assisted failure behaviours in materials and structures. By applying advanced modelling techniques, like phase-field theory, I assess structural integrity and explore innovative ways to enhance design or develop new materials. Currently, I am delving into the fascinating field of additive manufacturing, investigating their unique mechanics and failure mechanisms, including fracture and corrosion. This journey continually fuels my curiosity for advancing our approach to resilient, high-performance structures.
